Project 04: Develop a software program in Python (Develop an application to manage a chess tournament)

    A. Description of the "Chess Tournament" application

      It is an offline Python application corresponding to the main.py code that runs in the terminal.
      Its purpose is to manage the running of tournaments organized by a chess club.

      These tournaments must follow the Swiss system for generating the player pairs for each round of a tournament so that
      matches are fair and do not reoccur.

      In fact, this application allows to:
        *   add players to a database corresponding to the chess_db.json file,
        *   modify the rankings of the players by modifying the database,
        *   create and start a new tournament by modifying the database,
        *   select and resume an existing tournament by modifying the database,
        *   display reports that each correspond to:
              -   the list of all existing players in the database in order,
              -   the list of all existing tournaments in the database in order,
              -   the list of all participants in order,
              -   the list of all round matches of an existing tournament in the database.

    B. Structure du code en utilisant le design pattern MVC

        The structure of the application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.
        This structure contains the flake8_report folder generated by the command:

                flake8 --format=html --htmldir=flake8_report --max-line-length=119

        This folder contains the index.html file that can be launched by a web browser and corresponds to
        the web page indicating that the code structure of the application does not contain errors.

    C. Creating the flake8_report folder

        *   install the flake8 module using the command:
                pip install flake8
        *   create the two files .flake8 and .gitignore and in the project folder (working folder)
        *   Type and run the command in the terminal:
                flake8 --format=html --htmldir=flake8_report --max-line-length=119

    D. The steps to follow to execute the main script (main.py) of the project 04:

      I. Preparation of the project environment

	    1. Download and install Python version 3.10
            1.1.  Download Python 3.10 using the URL https://www.python.org/downloads/ and
                  choosing your Windows, macOS or Linux/Unix system
            1.2.  Click the download link
            1.3.  Install this version of Python that has the venv module. However, version < 3.3 does not have venv.
		
	    2. Download and install the latest version of Git (Package Version Manager)
            2.1.  Download the latest version of Git using the URL https://git-scm.com/downloads/
                  and choosing your Windows, macOS or Linux/Unix system
            2.2.  Click the download link
            2.3.  Install this version of Git that has a Git Bash terminal
		
	    3. Download and install the latest version of PyCharm
            3.1.  Download the latest version of PyCharm using the URL https://www.jetbrains.com/en-us/pycharm/
            3.2.  Click the Download button
            3.3.  Choose your Windows, macOS or Linux/Unix system
            3.4.  Click the Download button of the Community free version for pure Python development
            3.5.  Install this version of PyCharm which has Git: package version manager.
                  PyCharm also has a PS (PowerShell) terminal similar to the "Windows PowerShell" terminal

      II. Creating a virtual environment (e.g. env) using "Git Bash" or "PyCharm" terminal

        1.  Run "Pycharm" or "Git Bash" to access its terminal
        2.  Navigate to your project folder (P04, for example) that has already been created by running the command:
                cd P04
        3.  Type and run the command below to create a new virtual environment named env:
                python -m venv env

      III. Activation and Deactivation virtual environment using "Git Bash" or "PyCharm" terminal

        1.  Activation under MacOS or Linux/Unix of the virtual environment using the "Git Bash" terminal by running:
                source env/bin/activate
        2.  Activate the virtual environment on Windows using the "Git Bash" terminal by running the command:
                source ./env/Scripts/activate
        3.  Activation under Windows of the virtual environment using the "PyCharm" terminal by running the command:
                env/Scripts/activate

            In case the virtual environment has not been activated, you can run, before activation, the command:
                Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
            So, you can use these two links to help you solve this problem:
                https://www.windows8facile.fr/powershell-execution-de-scripts-est-deactivee-activer/
                https://www.pctricks.com/practice/tricks/3908.htm

        4.  Deactivate the virtual environment using the "Git Bash" or "PyCharm" terminal by running the command:
                deactivate

      IV. Cloning of the GitHub repository from the link https://github.com/RochdiGZ/OC_Project_04_Repository
        1.  Go to "Git Bash" or "Pycharm" terminal to clone the project locally on your computer
        2.  Type and run the command below using the link above
                git clone https://github.com/RochdiGZ/OC_Project_04_Repository.git
        3.  Launch PyCharm and open the added project locally, in the working folder, named OC_Project_04_Repository
            and having been hosted on GitHub and containing the following files:
              * README.md: contains the steps to follow to to run the main script (main.py)
              * Requirements.txt: contains all packages (packages) needed to run Python scripts
              * main.py: contains the main script to run it in the virtual environment named env
              * folders controllers, models and views contain Python files needed to run the main script (main.py)

      V. Running the main.py Python script

        1.  Create the virtual environment named env (see paragraph II.)
        2.  Activate the virtual environment env that was created previously (see paragraph III.)
        3.  Go to the "Git Bash" or "PyCharm" terminal to type and run the command which allows, first of all, to
            update the pip module :
                python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        4.  Type and run the command that installs the packages needed to run the main script (main.py)
                pip install -r requirements.txt
        5.  Finally, run the main script main.py, in the virtual environment, using the command :
                python main.py
